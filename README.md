# Music Streaming Platform Database

Streaming services are becoming more and more popular, replacing the purchase of physical or digital media with a subscription model. By paying a monthly fee, users can access a vast library of content.

For this **Database** course project at NOVA FCT, we designed a database to simulate a music streaming platform similar to Spotify. The database supports core functionalities such as representing artists, albums and songs, as well as user playback history, enabling recommendations and tracking user activity.


## Entity-relationship Model

Below is the Entity-relationship model of the database:

- **Oracle APEX:** Create an interactive web application to visualise and interact with the available database data.

This project was initially intended to be developed by a team of three people; however, I completed it alone.
